This is the repo for my personal/portfolio site. It can be viewed at [tmgast.github.io](http://tmgast.github.io).

This is a live project as I continue to brush up on web development skills and learn new tricks, tools, and frameworks.

To see what is currently in progress, have a look at the [TODO](https://github.com/tmgast/tmgast.github.io/blob/main/TODO.md).
